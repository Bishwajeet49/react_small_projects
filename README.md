This repository contains a React application that fetches user data from an API and displays it in a card-based layout. It demonstrates the implementation of fetching data from an external API and rendering it in a React component.

Features:
- Fetches user data from an API and displays it in cards
- Automatically fetches and displays a user's data on component mount
- Allows the user to manually fetch and add another user's data to the list
- Implements a shimmer effect as a placeholder for the user cards while data is being fetched
- Responsive design with a simple and intuitive user interface
